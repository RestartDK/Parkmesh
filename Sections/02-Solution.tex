\subsection{Solution}
Our innovation transforms every equipped vehicle into an active node within a city-wide mesh network. By attaching a simple, ultra-low-cost retrofit device to vehicles, we enable them to sense adjacent parking vacancies and relay this information in real-time. This creates a self-organizing network where parked cars themselves become the infrastructure that solves the parking problem. Then, for the drivers to see the available vacancy they will see it with an app their carplay display that will show in real time where they need to go for their parking spot.

When a driver approaches their destination, our system provides instant guidance to the nearest available parking space based on live data from the surrounding vehicle network. No more circling, no more guessing, and no wasted time or fuel.
