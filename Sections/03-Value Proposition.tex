\subsection{Value Proposition}
Our parking solution fundamentally re-imagines the approach to solving urban parking challenges by transforming every equipped vehicle into a node in a decentralized sensing network. Unlike traditional fixed-infrastructure systems that require massive upfront capital, lengthy municipal approvals, and remain vulnerable to system-wide failures, our ultra-low-cost vehicle retrofit creates an organic mesh network that grows stronger with each adoption.
While existing solutions rely on expensive sensors embedded in streets or garages, our approach leverages the very vehicles causing congestion to become the solutionâ€”providing real-time, accurate parking availability data precisely where it's needed most, scaling automatically in high-demand areas, and delivering immediate ROI through saved time and fuel while reducing emissions. By eliminating the need for fixed infrastructure and municipal coordination, we've created a solution that can be implemented immediately, at a fraction of the cost, while providing superior reliability through its distributed architecture.

Parking Mesh is positioned to address a \$5.8 billion smart-parking market (2023) \footcite{MarketResearchFuture2032}, projected to grow to \$14.1 billion by 2033 \footcite{MarketResearchFuture2032}, while also aligning with the \$5.6 billion parking-management sector \footcite{StraitsResearch2033} and tapping into the \$7.7 billion automotive sensor-aftermarket\footcite{GrandViewResearch2030} opportunity.
