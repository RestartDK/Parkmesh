\subsection{Reward Function}

The reward definition for an agent in our system needs to avoid issues that come with a delayed or infrequent reward. This can cause the learning to have a low convergence ability. To avoid this, we propose auxiliary rewards needed for faster convergence, such as penalties for frequent repetition of routes or extra driving distance. This is especially important since we have a high degree of constraints in our problem with the legality of parking in specific areas and due to the nature of parking being in high demand in metropolitan areas. However, the formal version of it will have to be found through iterations in order to optimize the behaviour of our agents. As we are acquiring more data, we will also adapt and improve the reward function.
