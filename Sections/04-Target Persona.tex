\subsection{Target Persona}
Our solution targets urban drivers who experience significant frustration with daily parking. These individuals value their time highly and feel stressed by the unpredictability of finding parking in congested areas. They typically commute to busy districts where parking is limited and spend 5-15 minutes daily searching for spaces, creating both financial costs from wasted fuel and emotional strain from the anxiety about being late.

Their primary pain points include the unpredictable time wasted circling for parking, the accumulated financial cost of fuel consumption during this search in total, and the stress of potentially being late to work or appointments. Many have attempted workarounds like arriving extremely early or paying premium rates for guaranteed parking, but remain dissatisfied with these compromises.

These customers are motivated primarily by time efficiency and cost savings, with environmental benefits serving as a welcome but secondary consideration. They seek solutions that provide immediate, tangible benefits and integrate seamlessly into their existing routines without requiring significant behaviour changes and upfront cost. They respond positively to promises of certainty, time savings, and stress reduction in their daily commutes.
