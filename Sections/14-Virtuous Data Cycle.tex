\subsection{Virtuous Data Cycle}

To maintain performance over time, agent policies will be retrained quarterly using anonymized, aggregated performance data collected by the system. This process allows the system to adapt dynamically to changes in city layouts, traffic patterns, and parking behavior. Future development may include integration of federated learning approaches, enabling neighborhoods or districts to locally refine policies without central data aggregation, preserving privacy while enhancing performance and avoiding model drift.
