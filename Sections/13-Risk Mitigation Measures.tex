\subsection{Risk Mitigation Measures}

Several risks have been identified in the system. Sensor faults and failures could undermine data quality, which will be addressed through periodic calibration procedures. Privacy concerns arising from location data collection will be mitigated through encryption and privacy-by-design protocols. Mesh network vulnerabilities, such as false or malicious vacancy reports, will be countered using trust scoring and anomaly detection systems that monitor and validate node behaviors within the network.
