\subsection{Problem}
Urban drivers waste \$345 billion annually circling for parking spaces in urban environments \footcite{CHEM}. This inefficiency stems from the fundamental challenge of information asymmetry - drivers enter parking areas with no reliable way to determine where available spaces exist. They circle blocks repeatedly, wasting time, fuel, and adding to urban congestion and pollution.
